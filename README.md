clustering algorithm for computing max-spacing 

## algorithm 1  
Given number of clusters k, computing max-spacing  

The input file describes a distance function (equivalently, a complete graph with edge costs).  It has the following format:  

[number_of_nodes]  
[edge 1 node 1] [edge 1 node 2] [edge 1 cost]  
[edge 2 node 1] [edge 2 node 2] [edge 2 cost]  
...  

There is one edge (i,j)(i,j) for each choice of 1 \leq i \lt j \leq n1≤i<j≤n, where nn is the number of nodes.
